# What Does “Perl” Stand For?

# Perl is sometimes called the “Practical Extraction and Report Language,” although it
# has also been called a “Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister,” among other expan-
# sions. It’s actually a backronym, not an acronym, since Larry Wall—Perl’s creator—
# came up with the name first and the expansion later. That’s why “Perl” isn’t in all caps.
# There’s no point in arguing which expansion is correct: Larry endorses both.
# You may also see “perl” with a lowercase p in some writing. In general, “Perl” with a
# capital P refers to the language and “perl” with a lowercase p refers to the actual inter-
# preter that compiles and runs your programs.
