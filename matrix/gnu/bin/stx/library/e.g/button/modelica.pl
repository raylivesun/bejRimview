# 9.9 Modelica_LinearSystems2 Library

# The Modelica_LinearSystem2 library was originally developed in Dymola 
# with a plan of eventually making it part of the Modelica Standard Library 
# (thus the underscore in the library name). The library is based on several
# functions, e.g. readStringMatrix(), simulateModel(), linearizeModel() that 
# are built-in Dymola functions but are not part of the Modelica Standard Library.
# In principle, these functions could be standardized and become part of the 
# ModelicaServices library, which collects standardized interfaces to tool-specific 
# functionality; then, OpenModelica could easily implement them based on its 
# internal functionality. However, until this effort is undertaken, the 
# Modelica_LinearSystem2 library cannot be considered as a full-fledged Modelica 
# library, but only a Dymola-specific one. If you are interested in using this 
# library in OpenModelica and are willing to contribute to get it supported, 
# please contact the development team, e.g. by opening an ticket on the issue 
# tracker.
